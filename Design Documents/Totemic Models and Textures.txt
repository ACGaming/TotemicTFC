Totemic models and art:

Models:

Preferably all models are cube-y (and fit into minecraft), and same goes for the textures, and preferably stick to 16x.

Wind Chime: Wind chimes are a instrument, they are made out of iron (for the bars) string connecting it with a bit of wood at the top. 4 metal bars is preferable to make it fit in.

War Bonnet: A helmet piece of armour thingy, it has the feathers and everything (Really low priority)

Tipi: A basic white tipi (by default) with the twigs at the top and everything, needs to be taller than one block.

Flute: A really basic flute, will only render in hand, preferable to have a little twig for detail, made out of wood (Oak).
