Totemic models and art:

Models:

Preferably all models are cube-y (and fit into minecraft), It's also preferable that the models were made in techne, if it is meant to have animation.

War Bonnet: A helmet piece of armour thingy, it has the feathers and everything (Really low priority)

Flute: A really basic flute, will only render in hand, preferable to have a little twig for detail, made out of wood (Oak).

Bow Holder: A armour thingy,it will let you hold the bow on your back for easy grabbing and holding of it (Really low priority aswell)

Buffalo Skull: A skull of a buffalo, with the horns and everything

Campfire: Just a few logs overcrossing each other, no flames needed since they will be handled in the code

Textures:

Items:

Buffalo Hide: Sorta like leather, just a darker shade.
Buffalo Hair: Brown coloured hair, just a small bunch of it together (sorta like how wheat looks)
Buffalo Teeth: Just a few teeth, white with a tiny bit of "decay".
Buffalo Hoove: The Hoove of a buffalo, another 'basic' thing :p
