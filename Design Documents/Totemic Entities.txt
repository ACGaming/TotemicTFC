Totemic Entities:

Buffaloes:

A 'advanced' version of cows, they have greater health.
You need to keep them alive, either by leaving them on a pasture (plains) or by feeding them.
The point of these are to provide major crafting components in Totemic.
The teeth can be used to create rattles, after you kill them you can take the teeth from them.
It drops a very large amount of meat, which obviously can be eaten.
It periodically drops dung, which can be used to fertilize crops.
You can turn the hooves into glue, which will then be used to create paint (A way to modify totem effects)
They will aid you in ceremonies.
It's horns will be made into a instrument, a horn which you blow into.
You can shear them for their fur.
The skin (leather) from then can be made into teepees (or tipi's, however you spell it)
