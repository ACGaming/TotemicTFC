<Sunconure11> i managed to also code up a new totem to take advantage of the luck system in MC
<Pokefenn> cant find the document
<Pokefenn> did you ever find/hear the thing i said ages ago about the grandfather thingy
<Pokefenn> ?
<Sunconure11> no not really
<Pokefenn> i dont remember it fully, but it was something like this
<Pokefenn> so there is the grandfather in the minecraft world, pretty much god
<Pokefenn> and he loves totemists
<Pokefenn> so your goal is to gain favour from him
<Pokefenn> you can do ceremonies to increase your favour with him
<Pokefenn> sacrifice animals
<Pokefenn> and just doing random totem stuff increases it slightly
<Sunconure11> i remember in the design plans there were the withered totemists, what would they be to him, if actually done?
<Pokefenn> if you gain enough favour, he starts to talk to you when you sleep
<Pokefenn> and eventually you can do trades with him
<Pokefenn> i dont remember it fully, but it was something like that
<Pokefenn> nah, withered totemists were something different
<Sunconure11> this is making me think of a dumb mod idea where you use dreams to gain the capacity to use magic
<Pokefenn> they were just the idea that you could destroy the things around you for power instead
<Sunconure11> which i have been writing down from time to time
<Sunconure11> but the idea is so ambitious that i will likely wait a bit if i do it
<Pokefenn> wait, brb, sorry :p
