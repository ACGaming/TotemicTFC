Totemic To do list:

Add in Totems for every mob
Bead Satchel (Totem Beads)
Finish off Ceremonies - Close to finished
Shadow Puppets (Could use Vazkiis corruption thingy, if i remember)
More baubles
Tools (Eventually)
Elfreet boss fight (Including the Halberd)
Pandora's Box (Spawns mobs, needs to be sealed with a ceremony once opened, gives great strengths?)
