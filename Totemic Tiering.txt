Totemic Tier Document:

Tier 0: Vanilla

This is the stage of the mod which is that of Vanilla, you have materials, redstone, iron, maybe a diamond or two, and also a farm with things.
In this stage you can craft a basic staff, which has little functions and is not specific, you can also craft a whittling knife.
Totemic will have a few things which will help you progress through this tier, at a later date.


Tier 1: Basic instruments and Totem ceremonies

This is the stage where you can start making things properly in the mod, 
Music Available Basic Drums, Stick Flute.
Things available to create in world: Totems and the Basic Ceremony Intelligence.
This stage will require a dedicated farm setup for many things.
You will be able to create a very basic ceremony intelligence, this will allow you to awaken your totems, and also do basic crafting.
The Totems you have will be limited, and be very inefficient.


Tier 2: Progressing through into Sylvan Magic

This is where your powers become more prominent, you will get access to the full ceremonies by creating Sylvan Wood, which is required to create the Ceremony.
You will be able to infuse your instruments here with powers through crafting ceremonies, making them have additional effects (So the drums will be great for mobtraps and react with redstone, and the flute will attract mobs)
These advanced instruments will allow you to also be able to do very late game Ceremonies, doing strong effects.
This is also where advanced baubles become available, such as the one which makes you do more damage with the less armour, and the worse your tool is, and the Hei-Tiki.
You will also be able to craft basic Head dresses, which will help you with working with Totems and Ceremonies.


Tier 3: Greater powers

This is where the player gets the great powers themselves, through the use of many things.
Item's created from this tier are through harder to do crafting through Ceremonies.
Totemic Armour will become available, this will be crafted using coloured feathers, Sylvan Wood, your old head dress, and also through a ceremony, this is very late game and is only to make things like Totems significantly stronger.
The Totem Beaded Satchel will be able to be created, this will allow you to bind Totems to players directly, this will become very inefficient though, and if things go wrong, you may suffer a little.
Shadow Puppets will be able to be created, they will mimic the players movements, attacking monsters and block breaking/placing, allowing for massive tasks to be done.
